### Basic Usage

1.  **Start the Application:** Run the development server as described in the [Installation Guide](#installation-guide).
2.  **Input Project Details:** Navigate to the application in your browser. You will be presented with fields to input your project's name, description, key features, installation steps, and more.
3.  **Generate README:** As you input information, the README will be dynamically generated and displayed in real-time.
